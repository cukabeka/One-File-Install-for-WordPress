OFI - One File Install for WordPress
==============================

One File Install (OFI) allows you to easily start with a fresh copy of WordPress without the hassle of downloading, unzip and uploading the required files


How does it work
--
Just copy the index.php file into your future WordPress directory and visit the site with your browser. After a short server check it will download the chosen WordPress version from [wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/)

The OFI index file will get removed automatically
